'''
A common data science problem is to find the minimum of an unknown function.
For example, all modern machine learning algorithms (including training large language models like chatgpt) are implemented this way.
In this file, you will explore some basic methods for finding the minimum using binary search.
'''


def argmin(f, lo, hi, epsilon=1e-3):
    '''
    Assumes that f is an input function that takes a float as input and returns a float with a unique global minimum,
    and that lo and hi are both floats satisfying lo < hi.
    Returns a number that is within epsilon of the value that minimizes f(x) over the interval [lo,hi]

    HINT:
    The basic algorithm is:
        1) The base case is when hi-lo < epsilon
        2) For each recursive call:
            a) select two points m1 and m2 that are between lo and hi
            b) one of the 4 points (lo,m1,m2,hi) must be the smallest;
               depending on which one is the smallest,
               you recursively call your function on the interval [lo,m2] or [m1,hi]

    WARNING:
    The doctests below are not intended to pass on your code,
    and are only given so that you have an example of what the output should look like.
    Your output numbers are likely to be slightly different due to minor implementation details.
    Writing tests for code that uses floating point numbers is notoriously difficult.
    See the pytests for correct examples.
    The test cases on github actions do not test these doctests.

def find_boundaries(f):
    '''
    Returns a tuple (lo,hi).
    If f is a convex function, then the minimum is guaranteed to be between lo and hi.
    This function is useful for initializing argmin.

    HINT:
    Begin with initial values lo=-1, hi=1.
    Let mid = (lo+hi)/2
    if f(lo) > f(mid):
        recurse with lo*=2
    elif f(hi) < f(mid):
        recurse with hi*=2
    else:
        you're done; return lo,hi
    '''


def argmin_simple(f, epsilon=1e-3):
    '''
    This function is like argmin, but it internally uses the find_boundaries function so that
    you do not need to specify lo and hi.

    NOTE:
    There is nothing to implement for this function.
    If you implement the find_boundaries function correctly,
    then this function will work correctly too.
    '''
    lo, hi = find_boundaries(f)
    return argmin(f, lo, hi, epsilon)
